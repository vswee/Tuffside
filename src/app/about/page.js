              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Tuffside Automotive Garage was born from a simple belief: every vehicle 
                deserves honest, expert care, and every customer deserves to be treated 
                like family. What started as a small operation has grown into one of 
                Trinidad's most trusted automotive service providers.
              </p>
              <p>
                For over 15 years, we've been the go-to garage for drivers who value 
                quality workmanship, fair pricing, and genuine customer service. We've 
                built our reputation one satisfied customer at a time, and we're proud 
                to serve our community with integrity and expertise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you drive a compact car, a heavy-duty truck, or anything in 
                between, we treat every vehicle with the same level of care and attention. 
                Because at Tuffside, we don't just fix cars - we keep families moving.
